# Professional Portfolio

URL: placeholder

Purpose: This page was made to showcase my projects and web development skills, and to provide future employers and collaborators examples of my work.

## Description and Functionality

This website is a portfolio page for prospective employers or future collaborators to learn about me, find examples of my web development work, and to find ways to get in contact with me. There is a functional nav bar at the top, which helps the user to quickly find the relevant sections. There is a profile section with information about me. There is a work gallery with links to my projects. At the moment, these are placeholders, but they will be updated as I complete more projects. There is a contact section with links to email me, and my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. The page is built to change dynamically with the user's screen size.
